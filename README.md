## Description 

This is my react portfolio. It was built with `React` so I wrote in primarily JS and CSS. I implemented `react-router` for easy routing and deployed with `github-pages`. 

## Future Development
I started with grander ideas than how it turned out, but I was on a time crunch. I look forward to jumping back in and doing something different.


Thanks for stopping by
