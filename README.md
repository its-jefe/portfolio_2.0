## Description 

This is my `React` portfolio. I implemented `react-router-dom` for easy routing and deployed with `github-pages`. 

## Future
I started with grander ideas than how it turned out, but I was on a time crunch. I look forward to jumping back in and doing something different.


Thanks for stopping by
