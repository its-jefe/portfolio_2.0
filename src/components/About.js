        <p className="">
          I'm a burgeoning computer science student, developer, web admin, and IT professional. I am an aesthete who lives to learn, create, solve problems and improve upon things. I enjoy designing thoughtful user experiences, tinkering with and expanding on my logic/algorithms, and troubleshooting. I am currently pursuing a bachelors degree in computer science.

          {/* I <em>try</em> to embrace everything with an open mind. I enjoy spending time with familty and friends, guitar, producing music (I dabble), video games, any sports, and chess. I thoroughly enjoy games and healthy competition. */}
